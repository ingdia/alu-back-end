# ALU Back-End - API Project

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to interact with a REST API to retrieve employee data and their TODO list progress. It is designed as part of the African Leadership University (ALU) backend curriculum, showcasing the use of Python to work with APIs instead of traditional shell scripting.
